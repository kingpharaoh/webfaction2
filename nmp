Installing Packages with npm

npm is the Node.js package management tool. To install a package with npm:

    Open an SSH session to your account.

    Switch to your Node.js application’s directory. Enter cd $HOME/webapps/nodejs_app/, where nodejs_app is the name of your Node.js application as it appears on the control panel, and press Enter.

    Add the application’s bin directory to your PATH environment variable.

	  Enter export PATH=$PWD/bin/:$PATH and press Enter.

    Enter npm install -g package, where package is the name of the package to be installed, and press Enter.
